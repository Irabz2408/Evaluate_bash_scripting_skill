# Evaluate_bash_scripting_skill

The objective this project is to advace the knowledge of shell scripting while also integrating and utilizing cloud services.The project focussed on 5 critical concepts, functions, arrays, environment variables, command line arguments and error handling. The aim is to elevate the knowledgeto a level where one can confidently navigate and harness the power of both shell scripting and cloud computing. For better understanding, the project simulated a real world scenario to demostrate it.

# DEMO 

### Background 
Datawise Solution is a forward-thinking Data Science Consulting Company that specializes in deploying analytical and machinelearning environment to support data-driven decision making for its clients. Recognising the need for agility and efficiency in setting up such environments, Datawise has decided to streamline its deployment process on AWS, focusing on simplicity and automation.


### Senario 
One of Datawise Solutions' clients, a burgeoning e-commerce startup is looking to harness the power of data science to analyze customer behaviour and enhance their shopping experience. The startup wishes to deploy their data science workshop on AWS utilizing EC2 instances for computational tasks and S3 buckets for storing their vast datasets of customer interactions.

### Specific Requirementts
To meet the client's needs, Datawise plans to develop a script that automates the setup of EC2 instances and S3 buckets. The script incorporate the 5 critical shell scripting concepts mentioned earlier.
